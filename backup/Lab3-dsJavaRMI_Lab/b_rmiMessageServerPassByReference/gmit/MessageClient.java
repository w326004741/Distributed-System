/* MessageClient is obviously a client of our remote message service. The Naming.lookup
 * is a request to a remote registry for an object with a human-readable name. The object 
 * returned is really an instance of MessageServiceImpl_Stub.class, but our client thinks
 * it is dealing with the real remote object (MessageServiceImpl_Stub also implements 
 * MessageService). The lookup() method returns a type of java.lang.Object which we need
 * to cast to the interface type. The statement:
 *			RemoteMessage message = ms.getMessage();
 * 		is the actual remote method invocation. Notice how there no special coding required
 * to deal with the remote invocation. This is an example of Local/Remote Transparency.
 *
 *
 * Note also that there is no reference to any server-side object type except for the remote
 * interfaces. The client is loosely-coupled with the remote objects. If we don't like our
 * implementation of the remote objects, we can substitute these with different classes that
 * implements MessageService and RemoteMessage without having to recompile the client. We would 
 * however, have to run the rmic compiler over the newer remote objects and figure out a way of
 * getting the generated stubs to the client (more about this later!).
